        <div class="line"></div>
            <p style="font-size: larger;" class="para">Mother Earth, also known as Earth Mother, is the third planet from the sun in the Solar System that we live in. As far as we know, it is the only planet to be found that supports life. Mother Earth provides us with water and air, which are very essential for life, without it, no living being would survive without it. Mother Earth is also a Greek goddess of Earth, Gaia. Gaia was the Greek goddess of Earth, mother of all life, similar to the Roman Terra Mater (Mother Earth).</p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;">Earth's natural resources include air, water, soil, minerals, plants, and animals. Conservation is the practice of caring for these resources so all living things can benefit from them now and in the future.</p>

            <hr>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">We can do simple things to protect our Earth such as planting a tree or any plant, conserving water and using it only when we need such as taking shorter showers and using a bucket and a mug to bath, shopping wisely and buying less plastic, not throwing waste or any other harmful materials into the water bodies such as plastic, glass, or any other harmful chemical, and many more. </p>
